            ----------------------------------
            Krusader installation instructions
            ----------------------------------


--- Note

Krusader-2.5.0 versions and higher use libraries like Qt5 and KF5, and will not
work anymore on KDE Plasma 4 or older.

--- Supported Platforms

* All POSIX (Linux®/BSD/UNIX®-like OSes), Solaris™

At the moment, for some libraries like KF5, there are no full ports for Windows
or Mac® OS X, which means these platforms are not supported.


========================================
Installation on Linux® and BSD platforms
========================================


--- Preliminary steps if Krusader was already installed

If Krusader was already installed: it's better to backup its settings before
uninstalling Krusader and installing a new version. Those folders can be
backed up (just in case):
        ~/.local
        ~/.kde
        ~/.config


--- Krusader dependencies

The next packages are needed when running the Krusader binary.

This is a list of the package names that Kubuntu/Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) use, other
Linux distros will probably use similar names:

- plasma-framework      Plasma Runtime components
- libc6                 GNU C Library: Shared libraries
- libgcc1               GCC support library

--- Suggested packages

The next packages are optional but they will make Krusader much more powerful and useful.

- zip                   Archiver for .zip files


--- Compilation requirements

The next packages are needed for compiling the Krusader sourcecode, if you only
run the Krusader binary you don't need to install these packages.

- build-essential        a group of packages needed to compile source code
- cmake                  a cross-platform, open-source make system
- extra-cmake-modules    extra cmake modules for compiling KDE Frameworks
- qt5-default            development files for the Qt5 libraries
- gettext                GNU Internationalization utilities
- plasma-framework-dev   development files for plasma-framework [in newer
                         versions the name is "libkf5plasma-dev"]
- zlib1g-dev             in order to make building easier (https://stackoverflow.com/a/49072832)

The following packages should install (through dependencies) all the packages
you need to compile KF5 software:
- kio-dev                resource and network access abstraction [in newer
                         versions the name is "libkf5kio-dev"]
- libkf5archive-dev      development files for karchive
- libkf5parts-dev        development files for kparts
- libkf5wallet-dev       development files for kwallet-framework
- libkf5xmlgui-dev       user configurable main windows
- kdoctools-dev          development files for kdoctools5


--- Krusader development download

Krusader is developed in KDE Extragear. If someone wants to download and use
the latest available Krusader sourcecode with git:
$ git clone https://anongit.kde.org/krusader

Otherwise, if someone wants to use the .tar.xz package:
$ tar xvf krusader-xx.xx.tar.xz


--- Some CMake options. CMake execution

These are some CMake options that can be used, it's not necessary to use
them all (later there's an example):

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
  is the location where Krusader will be installed with the make command.
  Another example is: -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PRFIX=/opt/krusader
  to install the compiled Krusader in an other directory to not overwrite
  the Krusader version installed by your package manager.

-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O2 -fPIC"
  this flag is required if you have a 64 bit system

-DQT_PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR=
  many system force this path to keep kde4 plugins separated from the kde5 ones

-DKDESU_PATH=/foo/bar/kdesu
  this needs to be set on distributions that override default kdesu installation
  path (libexec/kf5/kdesu) or if your install prefix doesn't match KDE's.

-DENABLE_SYNCHRONIZER=OFF
  disables building the Synchronizer module. This module caused data loss, now
  it is fixed, but we treat it as the thin ice.

In order to make sure that the present folder is the parent directory of the "krusader" source code folder, this command can be executed:
    ls krusader/krusader
and it should answer something like:
    abstractpanelmanager.h  Dialogs     kicons.h           KrJS            krusaderlisterui.rc
    [...]
then CMake can be executed this way:
$ mkdir krusader-build
$ cd krusader-build
$ cmake ../krusader -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-O2 -fPIC" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O2 -fPIC"

Note: An example of an output of cmake can be seen in https://phabricator.kde.org/w/krusader/cmake-output/


--- Compilation and installation

Compilation will take about 5 to 10 minutes depending on your CPU speed.

Execute:
# Note: On a multi cpu/core system you might want to speed up the compile process by increasing the number of jobs (e.g. `make -j4`)
$ make

# At the beginning of the following command: `sudo` must be added if Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Debian, or similar is being used
$ su -c "make install"

Note: An example of an output of make can be seen in https://phabricator.kde.org/w/krusader/make-output/


--- To achieve that Krusader uses another language

There is a list of translation files in the [10n.kde.org Krusader page](https://l10n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kf5/po/krusader.po/index.html).
In that list anyone can look for his desired translation file, hover the mouse cursor over its link, see its tooltip to look up the
appropriate LANGUAGE_CODE (which is shown between parentheses, e.g. if on the tooltip it's seen "German (de)" that means that
LANGUAGE_CODE is: de), click on the link (in order to download the proper krusader.po file), and execute:

    # Transform the downloaded file
    msgfmt krusader.po -o krusader.mo

    # At the beginning of the following command: `sudo` must be added if Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Debian, or similar is being used.
    # In the following command, the text XXXXXXX must be replaced by the LANGUAGE_CODE that was previously found
    su -c "cp -a krusader.mo /usr/share/locale/XXXXXXX/LC_MESSAGES/"

Note: If, in the future, someone would need to automate the downloading of a krusader.po file, he could use:
    # In the following command, the text XXXXXXX must be replaced by the LANGUAGE_CODE that was previously found
    $ wget -U "Mozilla/5.0" https://websvn.kde.org/*checkout*/trunk/l10n-kf5/XXXXXXX/messages/extragear-utils/krusader.po


--- Execution

Finally, Krusader can be executed this way:
$ krusader


--- Uninstall

# At the beginning of the following command: `sudo` must be added if Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Debian, or similar is being used
$ su -c "make uninstall"
